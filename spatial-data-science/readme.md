# Spatial and Urban Data Science

This module introduce the basics of working with spatial data and conducting spatial network analysis.

1. Basic spatial data and GIS operations using [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/), which spatializes pandas dataframes. It uses the [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) package for geometry.

2. Spatial network modeling and analysis with [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io), which allows you to download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks (and other spatial data) anywhere in the world from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84), an open source geodatabase that provides freely accessible spatial data worldwide.

3. Urban accessibility analysis using [Pandana](https://udst.github.io/pandana/), which uses contraction hierarchies for imprecise but very fast shortest path calculation.
